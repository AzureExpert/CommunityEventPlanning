# Community Event Planning
The intent of this repo is to provide community members with resources to plan small, usually not-for-profit events like small local conferences such as Code Camps and "&lt;insert tech&gt; Saturdays." My hope is to gather knowledge and tools from all community spaces, make them findable and available here, and most of all community-owned and driven. Different communities have different needs, and even different needs in different regions within the same communities. I hope for this to be a space to be a springboard where aspiring event organizers can the tools and contacts they need to host a local event.

Some of these ideas can be expanded to apply to larger regional and for-profit conferences as well; however, the intended scope is the smaller local event. These events are important seeding grounds for those wishing to speak at larger conferences, but who may not have the experience or confidence to submit to speak at larger events. They provide a space for local enthusiasts who may not have the time or financial resources to attend larger conferences and those who find such conferences intimidating. These events are also vital to linking local communities to their larger regional, national, and global brethren.
